# Comprehensive Security Monitoring System üõ°Ô∏èüîç

This repository documents the implementation of a comprehensive monitoring system for tracking security events, network traffic, and system metrics. It combines the strengths of Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for visualizations, and Wazuh with Splunk (or an open-source alternative like OpenSearch/Elasticsearch within a SIEM solution like Security Onion) for SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) functionalities.

**Important Note:** This is a complex setup. The provided configurations are examples and starting points. You MUST adapt them to your specific infrastructure, security policies, and monitoring goals. Thoroughly test each component.

## üéØ Goals

* Proactively detect security incidents and anomalies.
* Centralize the collection and analysis of log data and system metrics.
* Visualize security-relevant data in dashboards.
* Alert on critical events.
* Support forensic analysis and incident response.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

* **Metrics Collection & Alerting:**
    * [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): Collects metrics from various exporters.
    * [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/): Handles alerts from Prometheus.
* **Visualization:**
    * [Grafana](https://grafana.com/): Creates dashboards to visualize metrics and logs.
* **SIEM & Log Management:**
    * [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/): Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), log analysis, and security monitoring.
    * [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) (or [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/)/[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) as an open-source alternative, often part of solutions like Security Onion).
* **Exporters & Agents:**
    * Prometheus Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, etc.
    * Wazuh Agents.
    * Splunk Universal Forwarder (if using Splunk) or Beats/Fluentd (for OpenSearch/Elasticsearch).
* (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose for easier deployment of some components.

## ‚ú® Key Features/Highlights

* **Centralized Monitoring:** Aggregation of data from various sources in one place.
* **System Metrics:** Monitoring of CPU, RAM, disk, and network utilization of critical systems with Prometheus and Node Exporter.
* **Security Event Correlation:** Using Wazuh and Splunk/OpenSearch to analyze log files (e.g., auth.log, syslog, firewall logs) and detect suspicious activities.
* **Network Traffic Analysis Insight:** Monitoring network traffic for anomalies (e.g., with Wazuh NIDS capabilities or Prometheus Blackbox Exporter for service availability).
* **Custom Dashboards:** Creation of informative Grafana dashboards for visualizing security metrics, system states, and alerts.
* **Alerting System:** Configuration of alerts in Prometheus Alertmanager and/or Wazuh/Splunk for critical security events (e.g., failed logins, suspicious processes, system outages).
* **SIEM Functionality:** Rule-based threat detection, compliance monitoring, and incident response support through Wazuh and Splunk/OpenSearch.
* **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to add more hosts and data sources as needed.

## üèõÔ∏è Repository Structure

(A brief overview of the key directories and their purpose)

* `docs/`: Installation and configuration guides for individual components and the overall architecture.
* `prometheus/`: Configuration files and alert rules for Prometheus and Alertmanager.
* `grafana-dashboards/`: Example Grafana dashboard JSON models.
* `wazuh-config/`: Example configurations for Wazuh manager and agents, and custom rules.
* `splunk-config/` or `opensearch-config/`: Example configurations for data inputs.
* `docker-compose/`: Docker Compose files for deploying components like Prometheus, Grafana, and potentially Wazuh.

## üöÄ Getting Started / Configuration

Implementing such a stack is complex and highly dependent on your existing infrastructure. This repository provides an overview and example configurations.

1.  **Understand the Architecture:** Review the [`docs/architecture-overview.md`](./docs/architecture-overview.md).
2.  **Component Setup:**
    * **Prometheus & Grafana:** See [`docs/prometheus-grafana-setup.md`](./docs/prometheus-grafana-setup.md) and the `docker-compose/prometheus-grafana-compose.yml`.
    * **Wazuh:** See [`docs/wazuh-setup.md`](./docs/wazuh-setup.md). A Docker Compose setup for Wazuh is also available from Wazuh's official resources.
    * **Splunk/OpenSearch:** See [`docs/splunk-opensearch-setup.md`](./docs/splunk-opensearch-setup.md).
3.  **Agent Deployment:** Deploy agents (Node Exporter, Wazuh agents, Splunk UF/Beats) to the hosts you want to monitor.
4.  **Data Source Configuration:** Configure Prometheus targets, Wazuh agents to report to the manager, and data inputs in Splunk/OpenSearch.
5.  **Dashboard Creation:** Import existing Grafana dashboards or create your own. Utilize Wazuh and Splunk/OpenSearch visualization tools.
6.  **Alerting:** Define alerting rules in Prometheus, Wazuh, and Splunk/OpenSearch.

## üîÆ Potential Improvements/Future Plans

* Integration of Threat Intelligence Feeds.
* Automated response actions (SOAR-like functionalities on a small scale).
* Expansion of monitoring to cloud resources.
* Regular review and tuning of alerting rules and dashboards.

**Disclaimer:** Security is an ongoing process. This setup provides tools for monitoring, but effective security also depends on proper configuration, regular updates, incident response planning, and a security-conscious culture.

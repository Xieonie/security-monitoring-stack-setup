# props.conf.example for Splunk Search Head / Indexer
# Place this file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf or in a custom app.
# This defines how Splunk should parse data for specific sourcetypes.

# Example for a custom application log with JSON format
[myapp_log_json]
# Assuming logs are single-line JSON
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
LINE_BREAKER = ([\r\n]+)
KV_MODE = json
# Optional: Define timestamp extraction if not automatically picked up
# TIME_PREFIX = \"timestamp\":\s*\"
# TIME_FORMAT = %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3N%Z
# MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 30

# Example for a multi-line log format (e.g., Java stack traces)
[my_java_app_log]
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = true
# Break before a line starting with a timestamp (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
BREAK_ONLY_BEFORE = \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}
# Optional: Truncate lines longer than X characters
# TRUNCATE = 10000
# Optional: Define timestamp
# TIME_PREFIX = ^
# TIME_FORMAT = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
# MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 20

# Example for Wazuh alerts if forwarded as JSON and sourcetyped as 'wazuh_alerts_json'
[wazuh_alerts_json]
KV_MODE = json
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
# Wazuh JSON alerts usually have a 'timestamp' field. Splunk might pick it up automatically.
# If not, define TIME_PREFIX and TIME_FORMAT. Example:
# TIME_PREFIX = \"timestamp\":\s*\"
# TIME_FORMAT = %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3N%Z
# MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 30
# Optional: Field extractions using REPORT-* or KV_MODE=json as above.
# REPORT-wazuh_fields = wazuh_extract_json_fields

# For default sourcetypes like 'syslog', 'access_combined', 'apache_error',
# Splunk often has built-in parsing rules. You typically only add stanzas
# here to override default behavior or for custom sourcetypes.

# Note: After making changes to props.conf, Splunk needs to be restarted
# or metadata reloaded for the changes to take effect on new data.
